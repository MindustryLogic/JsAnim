Yes.
Purpose of this Javascript package/module thing is to make animation with as little typing as possible.
Currently in progress.
A webpage version of this documentation will be created some time later.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED ALL LOCATIONAL/SIZE UNIT ARE IN PIXELS
Current available functions and relationship:
  leftover functions:
    helloWorldBecauseYes(); and AltWay();
  This two function serves as a proof of concept and is unused in anyway, shape or form.
  Main functions:
    Add is class Main which includes:
      1.initDisplay(resolution, fps, includeSVG); in which:
      resolution is a string with format <Number>x<Number> where the first number is the width and the second number being the height, all in pixels.
      fps as a number which determines the delay for looping and duration counting, however this is not implemented yet.
      includeSVG is a boolean which dictates the usage of SVG. The default is true.
      WARNING: IF includeSVG IS SET TO FALSE ANY USAGE OF SVG WILL NOT BE SHOWN
      This function is mandatory as everything else (except DisplayDate) use this as a reference.
      Id of this display is hard coded as "RenderZone".

      2.DisplayData();
      Display Data that exist in "RenderZone" under "RenderZone"
      Further development of this function will also display item list inside "RenderZone" for reference.
      This function is mandatory as this define the target to add item into for ease of use and development.

      3.CreateRectCSS(width, height, startPos, color, id); in which:
      width and height is the number of well, width and height of the rectangle that is going to be created.
      startPos is a string with format of "<Number>x<Number>" which set the initial position of the rectangle.
      color is a string accepting both color values (#FFFFFF) and color names (red) for the initial color of the rectangle.
      id is a string which set the id of the rectangle.

      4.CreateRectSVG(width, height, startPos, color, id) which is exactly the same as CreateRectCSS() in practice.
